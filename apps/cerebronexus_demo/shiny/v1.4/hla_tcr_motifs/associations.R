## HLA & TCR Motifs — descriptive feature x HLA overlap
##
## This tab locks one node or motif from the already-built graph, then reports
## observed donor/sample overlap with one allele. It performs no enrichment test
## and never labels co-occurrence as restriction.
##----------------------------------------------------------------------------##

## A small info marker for a control label: a one-line, plain-language hover hint
## (native title tooltip, no modal). The "info" panel buttons open a dialog; a
## couple of controls just need a short "what is this?" instead.

## The two overlap tables update on every Feature-type/feature switch. Rendering

## and every data change is pushed through DT::replaceData() on a proxy, which
## swaps the rows in place without rebuilding the widget. Their dimensions are
## stable (summary = 3 status rows; breadth = one row per analysis unit), so
