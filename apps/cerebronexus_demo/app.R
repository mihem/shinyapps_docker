  ## They are embedded-backend .crb files, so no h5 matrix is configured. The
  ## PBMC set (Full, T+B) is listed first and loaded by default
  ## (crb_pick_smallest_file = FALSE); it carries TCR + BCR and a monocle2

    ## legible where an unselected repertoire's is not -- 12,000 cells give 169
    ## TRB nodes in 39 motifs on measured sequences. Donor genotypes are the
    ## PUBLISHED ones (table S1 of the source paper), measured independently of
    ## these cells, so the carrier contrasts are real; the repertoire is still
    ## antigen-selected and says so, since the reagent panel decided which
